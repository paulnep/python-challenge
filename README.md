# Python Fix-Me Challenge!

Welcome! This repository contains a simple Python script (`script_with_issues.py`) that has several **intentional bugs and areas for improvement**.

## The Challenge

Your goal is to:
1.  **Identify** the problems in `script_with_issues.py`.
2.  **Fix** the bugs and **improve** the code quality.
3.  **Submit** your changes via a Pull Request.

## Known Issues / Areas to Look At (Hints!)

* Potential `ZeroDivisionError` when calculating the average.
* Potential `TypeError` if the input lists contain non-numeric data.
* Logic error in the `get_numbers_above_threshold` function (check the comparison!).
* Inefficient code and unclear variable names (`d`, `th`).
* Lack of proper error handling or data validation.
* Missing comments or docstrings in some areas.
* The script continues running even after encountering errors in some calculations.

*(Feel free to find more issues than listed here!)*

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.
3.  Create a **new branch** for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b fix-average-bug`).
4.  **Modify** `script_with_issues.py` to fix one or more issues. Make sure your code is clear and well-commented.
5.  **Test** your changes to ensure they work correctly and don't introduce new bugs.
6.  **Commit** your changes with a descriptive message (e.g., `git commit -m "Fix: Prevent ZeroDivisionError in calculate_average"`).
7.  **Push** your branch to your fork on GitHub (e.g., `git push origin fix-average-bug`).
8.  Open a **Pull Request** from your branch back to the `main` branch of *this* original repository.
9.  Clearly describe the changes you made in the Pull Request description.

We'll review your contribution! This is meant to be a learning exercise.

## Setting Up (Optional)

If the script had external dependencies, you would typically install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
